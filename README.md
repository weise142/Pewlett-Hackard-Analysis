# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine how many employees are at retirement age and how many employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. When looking at employees at retirement age, we group them by title to help management understand where they need to allocate mentorship and hiring resources as the "silver tsunami" approaches. We determined retirement age employees by when they were born, employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Our first priority was pulling employee data from multiple file locations, then we combined the files into one table sorted by date of birth. We then used this table to create tables of unique job titles displaying the number of retirement age employees and then created a second table of employees who were born in 1965 who are eligible for a mentorship program. 
## Results
- Our Retirement Titles file displays every retirement age employee and how long they have worked at their respective positions within the company
- Our Unique Titles file displays the most recent job title for retirement age employees
- Our Retiring Titles file displays the number of retirement age employees by job title. This document illustrates the need for mentorship programs as the majority of retirement age employees are in senior titles; 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff

- Our Mentorship Eligibility file displays the employees in the company, born in 1965, who are eligible for a mentorship program within the company. This file displays how long the employee has been with the company and their job title. Below is an image of the beginnning of the file:

## Conclusion
Displaying the data of the coming "silver tsunami" is important for management as they will need to fill many positions in the coming years. If they are to fill these positions, they must also have a strong training and mentorship program within the company. Leveraging the Senior Engineers' and Senior Staff's knowledge and expertise before they retire will be an important part of the continuing success of the company. These senior staff can help onboard new hires, help mentor engineers, staff, and assistant engineers that will be able to take over their responsibilities when they retire. Using this data to prepare managers and Human Resources for the coming "silver tsunami" will be imperative for the success of the company.
